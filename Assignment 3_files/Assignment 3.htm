    Assignment 3: Streaming Video to Clients</span></h2>
<p class="c2">
	<span class="c0">Last Updated: March 25, 2013</span><br>
	<span class="c0">DUE: 23:59 April 6, 2013.</span>
</p>
<p class="c4 c2">
	<span class="c0"></span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
	<span class="c3 c0">NOTE:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;This assignment is
      quite doable on your own. However, you may do this assignment in
      pairs. As always, you are free to discuss the assignment and ways, at a
      high level, to solve various parts of the assignment. Ultimately the
      design and implementation </span><span class="c0 c7">must
      be</span><span class="c0"> developed by you and your partner, if you are working with one.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
	<span class="c0">In this assignment you will implement a more sophisticated
      version of the server you were provided with in assignment 2. In
      addition to a regular playback, your server is also expected to support
      the "Scale" header, which is used to play the video faster. Also, your
      server should be able to handle video files stored in a cloud storage
      system.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
	<span class="c0">This assignment must be developed using the C programming
      language
      (C++ is not allowed), and your
      code must run on the undergrad Linux machines. You are allowed
      to use any of the C libraries available at the undergrad machines,
      provided you change your Makefile to allow the code to run using a
      simple "make" command (more details about this below).
      <b>Warning:</b>Your code must run on the undergrad machines. If you 
      are using your own machine, even if it is Linux, it is possible that
      code developed on that machine will not compile or run properly on 
the department Linux machines. Different compilers, library versions, etc., could
      result in different behaviours or even the inability for the program to
      compile. So, should you use your own machine, be sure to allow time 
      to get it to run on the department machines, just in case. 


</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
	<span class="c0">Similar to assignment 2, the client and server communicate requests and responses
      between each other use the Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) and send
      the video data using the Real-time Transfer Protocol (RTP). However, due
      to limitations regarding firewalls and network rules in place at UBC, the
      RTP transfer will be interleaved in the same connection as RTSP. This
      means that both control and data will use the same TCP connection, and
      there will be rules in place to allow the client to separate RTSP
      and RTP traffic.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
	<span class="c0">We have
      provided you with an executable JAR file with the implementation 
of an
      RTSP client. Your task is to
      implement the RTSP and RTP protocols in the server. No skeleton 
code is provided, however you will find useful snippets of code below to
 help you
      with simple tasks. A sample Makefile is also provided, and you are
      welcome to change it as needed.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
	<span class="c0">When implementing this assignment you should write 
small pieces of code and then test and verify their functionality before
 proceeding. Implement the assignments functionality incrementally in 
the order it is presented in the description. </span>
</p>
<h3 class="c2"><a name="h.c04bwqvyz9an"></a><span class="c0">Part A:
    Streaming video content from a file</span></h3>
<p class="c1">
	<span class="c0">In part A you will create a server that will accept TCP
      connections and handle RTSP traffic through these connections. Your
      server will read a single argument from the command line, corresponding
      to the port number that will be used to accept connections. Your code is
      to print an error message if no argument is provided.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
	<span class="c0">When running your code, you must first start your server
      with a port of your choice (it will need to be between 1025 and 65535,
      unless you are root). Then you
      must start the provided client and provide the name of the host the server is
      running and the and the port number the server is using. Note that, although
      the client is able to support simple error scenarios, it is not
      particularly robust, so don't be surprised if the client crashes or
      doesn't function properly if your server isn't working. Basically, 
      to get a good user experience your server will need to be running 
      properly. Also note that the client will play the frames as it receives
      them from the server (in other words, there is no buffering or any other
      technique like the ones you used for part B of assignment 2). This means
      it is the server's responsibility to send the frames at the proper time
      and order.
</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
	<span class="c0">Your code is expected to handle multiple simultaneous
      connections, without interference between these connections. You are
      strongly encouraged to use threads for this purpose, however the use of
      forking is also allowed, as is an event driven approach using 
      <em>select()</em>. Note that the use of threads simplifies
      debugging of your code, but it also means that global and static
      variables affect other running threads if you don't handle them correctly.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
	<span class="c0">Once a connection is accepted, your server will wait for
      a complete RTSP request, parse it, process it correctly, and return a complete
      RTSP response. As in assignment 2, a complete RTSP request is composed of an
      initial line containing a method, a URL and the RTSP version, optional header
      lines containing additional information, followed by an empty line indicating the end of the
      request. Similarly a complete RTSP response contains a line including the
      RTSP version, a response code and a message, followed by optional header
      lines and finished by an empty line. All successful responses need to
      include at least two header lines: CSeq and Session.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
	<span class="c0">If the method you receive is SETUP, you must open the
      video file indicated in the request URL (corresponding to a file
      relative to the current working directory). If the file cannot be
      properly opened you must return an error response, but you should not
      close the socket connection or finish the thread. If you receive a SETUP
      request when a file is already open, you must return an error response
      as well. In case of success, you must generate a random session number
      and include it in the response.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
	<span class="c0">Since in this assignment the video data is interleaved
      with the RTSP control, there will be a different Transport header value
      as compared to assignment 2. In this case, Transport will replace the
      "client_port" keyword with "interleaved", indicating that data will not
      use a new connection, but the existing connection. You are not required
      to parse the Transport header, you can assume that the value will
      indicate an interleaved data. </span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
	<span class="c0">If the method you receive is PLAY, you will start a new
      timer that will "fire" every 40 ms (25 frames per second) and send to the 
      client a 
      successful response that includes the  same session number used in the
      previous SETUP response. The timer will be responsible for sending a single
      frame of the video to the client. Once all
      frames have been read from the file, the timer will stop. Note that it
      is very important that the code that is execute when the 
      timer fires  takes less than 40 ms to run, or
      else there will be overlap of timer runs. An error response is to be
      sent if you receive PLAY without a previous SETUP.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
	<span class="c0">A video frame must be sent in JPEG or PNG format,
      encapsulated in an RTP packet (described in the previous
      assignment). However, since the data will be interleaved with the RTSP
      traffic, a prefix must be included to avoid confusion between 
      responses and RTP packets. This prefix, in RTSP, is comprised of 4 bytes: a dollar sign
      ("$", ASCII 0x24), followed by a byte indicating the channel in use (in
      your case this is always zero), followed by two bytes containing the
      length of the RTP packet in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness#Endianness_in_networking">network order</a> (i.e., most significant byte
      first). This length must include the RTP packet header and payload, but
      should not include the four bytes of the prefix. Note that both the
      channel number and the length are represented in binary format (not a
      string representation), similar to what you see in the RTP header fields
      such as the timestamp and sequence number.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
	<span class="c0">An RTSP request with method PLAY will include a header
      line named "Scale". This line will contain a single number corresponding
      to the speed of play. A scale of 1 indicates regular playback speed; a
      scale of 2 indicates that playback will happen twice as fast as regular,
      and so on. You are expected to follow this information when sending
      frames to the client. Note, however, that the frame rate will continue
      to be the same, and the playback will only affect which frames are
      sent. In other words, if scale is 2, every other frame will be sent, and
      other frames will be skipped. If scale is 4, you will send one frame
      every 40 ms, and skip 3 frames in between, and so forth. The RTSP
      specification allows for a negative scale, to indicate backwards
      playback, but you are not required to support that.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
	<span class="c0">If you receive an RTSP request with method PAUSE, you
      will stop the currently running timer and send a successful response, but will keep the video file
      open. A PLAY following this PAUSE will continue where the previous
      streaming stopped.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
	<span class="c0">If you receive an RTSP request with method TEARDOWN, you
      will stop the currently running timer (if it is running), will close the
      video file and return a successful response. You must keep the
      connection open and change the state in such a way that further SETUP
      requests are accepted for new files.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
	<span class="c0">You may assume that you will receive a valid RTSP request
      ending with an empty line, however your server must be robust enough to
      handle error cases. Some possible error cases you must be able to handle
      include (but are not limited to) receiving methods when in the wrong state (e.g., a PLAY without
      a SETUP), files that don't exist, and unexpected connection interruptions.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
	<span class="c0">Your server should not expect any data to come from the
      standard input (stdin). You are welcome to print any debugging messages
      in the terminal (stdout/stderr), however having a clear indication of
      what is happening in each stage might help the TAs understand your code
      better when marking.</span>
</p>

<h4 class="c2"><a name="h.yn3p23u2cc6"></a><span class="c0">Compiling your Code</span></h4>
<p class="c1">
	<span class="c0">You are provided with a sample Makefile that assumes your
      code includes the files <tt>main.c</tt> and <tt>rtspd.c</tt> and the
      include <tt>rtspd.h</tt>. You can modify this file as necessary,
      however you must make sure that by running in a terminal:</span>
</p>
<p class="c2 c14">
	<span class="c0"><tt>make</tt></span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
	<span class="c0">an executable file named rtspd is generated, and runs
      according to the described specification.</span>
</p>

<h3 class="c2"><a name="h.fclxxjkebbd6"></a><span class="c0">Part B: Serving a
video from the cloud</span></h3>
<p class="c1">
	<span class="c0">As an extension of the server created for part A, you
      will now create a new server that, instead of reading a video file directly,
      obtains its data from a key/value cloud storage service. You will connect to a set
      of cloud servers and request specific video frames, and then serve these
      frames to your client similarly to the behaviour of part A. The image
      below shows the structure of the network.</span>
</p>
<img src="Assignment%203_files/image02.png">
<p class="c1">
	<span class="c0">The objective of this assignment is to build a real
      service that is able to simultaneously serve multiple users, while
      depending on back-end services provided by other systems. Existing
      Internet-scale systems heavily depend on key/value storage systems to
      store data reliably.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
	<span class="c0">The storage cloud has been setup as a single service for
      the entire class as a group of "cloud servers". The cloud servers each
      store different frames from different videos. The cloud servers are
      intended to communicate only with streaming servers, not clients.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
	<span class="c0">Your server will receive requests from clients as with
      part A. However, the URL of the video will start with
      "cloud://", followed by a video name. Similarly, when requesting a video
      in the RTSP client, you are expected to include "cloud://" before the
      video name. For example, a request to open the
      video "distributed_7" will contain in the first line the string:</span>
</p>
<pre>SETUP cloud://distributed_7 RTSP/1.0
CSeq: 1
Transport: RTP/TCP; interleaved=0</pre>
<p class="c1">
	<span class="c0">You are provided with 2 videos for testing: "correct" and
      "distributed". The difference between these videos is related to how
      distributed they are among different servers, and your solution must work
      with both of them. To balance the load among
      the different cloud servers, each of
      these videos is available in 10 different names through separate cloud
      servers. To help with load balancing you are encouraged to use the server corresponding to the last
      digit of your student ID. So, if your student ID is 12345678, you should
      use, for testing, the videos "correct_8" and "distributed_8". 
      (Keep in mind that all the files that start with correct are the same as
      are all the ones that start with distributed.) 
</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
	<span class="c0">Each frame of the different videos may be stored in a
      different cloud server. You are expected to connect to the server associated
      to each individual frame (using a regular TCP socket) and request the
      frame from that cloud server. To obtain the cloud server associated to
      each frame, you must call the function get_cloud_server(). This function
      is available by linking 
      cloud_helper.o (See the link in the <em>Provided files and resources</em>
      section) with your code and including
      the following line in the beginning of your C file:</span>
</p>
<pre>#include "cloud_helper.h"</pre>
<p class="c1">
	<span class="c0">The cloud_helper.o file was compiled in the undergrad
      Linux environment. Although the .o file  might work in a different setting,
      such as your laptop or home computer, it is not guaranteed to work in
      such an environment, so you are highly encouraged to test your code in
      the Linux undergrad computers. It definitely will not work 
      on a Windows or Mac. </span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
	<span class="c0">Once connected to a cloud server, your request must
      follow the format: <em>video_name:frame_number</em> followed by a
      line-feed character ("\n"). For example to request the frame 23 from
      video "distributed_4" you should send the string "distributed_4:23\n" to
      the cloud server. The server will respond with the length represented as
      a decimal 5-byte ASCII string, corresponding to the size of the frame,
      followed by the frame itself. For example, if the payload content of the
      frame is "abcdefg", the cloud server will send "00007abcdefg". Note that,
      depending on the size of the
      frame, you may not receive it in a single packet (thus it may require
      more than one call to recv). Also note that, if the cloud server doesn't
      understand your request, it will
      close the connection without sending any data. If the format of the
      request is correct, but the video frame you
      requested was not found, a zero-sized frame will be sent (in other
      words, only the string "00000" will be received), but the connection will
      be kept alive.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
	<span class="c0">Although the cloud servers are able to serve
      multiple frames in the same connection in sequence, two consecutive
      frames in the same video might not be
      served by the same cloud server. Even though you may want to start your
      assignment by closing the connection after each frame, in the final
      version of the assignment you should make every effort to keep
      the connection with cloud servers alive and use an active connection
      when possible. In other words, you should only establish a new connection when a
      frame is served by a different cloud server for whom you don't have an
      active connection, or when the connection with the cloud server has been
      previously closed by the cloud server. Note that it is possible that more than one
      connection with a cloud server may be active at a specific point in time,
      but you may assume that no more than five cloud servers will be used for
      the same video.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
	<span class="c0">In addition to "correct_X" and "distributed_X", two video
      files, called "missing_X" and "unpredictable_X" (replacing X by a digit
      0-9) are available. These videos will result in unexpected behaviours
      similar to the ones found in the second part of assignment 2. Although
      the majority of grades for part B will be focused on the
      correct/distributed videos, for full marks you are expected to have a
      server that is robust enough to handle unpredictable videos and serve them to
      the client as smoothly as possible.</span>
</p>
<p class="c1">
	<span class="c0">You are not required to serve regular video files (like
      the ones in part A) in this version of the assignment, although you are
      encouraged to do so if you have time.</span>

  <span class="c0">Since timer events can overlap with each other and with the
    main client thread, you are strongly encouraged to employ semaphores to
    avoid conflicts between threads. A good tutorial on semaphores is
